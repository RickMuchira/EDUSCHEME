## Getting Started

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
For enhanced AI generation, set up your Groq API key:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_api_key_here
```

If no API key is provided, the system uses an enhanced Biology Form 2 Term 1 template.
